Users:
Name, email, password

Protections from password-cracking attacks:
- password requirements???
- secure hash (how to store?)

Contacts:
For each user:
json file - named from some hash of name/email

Milestone 1:
- Encrypt password (salted hashes)
- Generate and store a unique ID for future authentication (non-collision hash function)
- Error handling (register_user)
- Nice-to-have: Password validation (regex)

Milestone 2:
- Memory clearing (decrypted password / entered password)

Milestone 3:
- Add secure_drop shell
- Add "add" (and "exit") command
Contacts file:
- AES (password as key)

Milestone 4:
- Look into a digital certificate system
